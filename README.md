# ðŸ§­ Maze Solver
Maze generator and solver, built using Python and Tkinter.

At the moment the maze is solved using the Depth-Search First (DFS) algorithm. 

## ðŸ“˜ How-To

1.  Download repository source code as ZIP
2.  Extract the file anywhere on your PC
3.  Open a terminal inside the extracted directory
4.  Run in terminal:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
    
## Coming Soon

-    Add other solving algorithms, like breadth-first search or A*
-    Create a loop to clear and regenerate and solve another maze
-    Mess with the animation settings to make it faster/slower
-    Add configurations in the app itself to allow users to change maze size, speed, etc
-    Make it a game where the user chooses directions
-    Make it 3 dimensional
-    Time the various algorithms and see which ones are the fastest
